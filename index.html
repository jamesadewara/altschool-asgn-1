          My passion for problem-solving began at the young age of 14, even
          though I lacked the resources to bring my initial solutions to life.
          Early on, I even delved into <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> as a
          prerequisite for a course, which led me to learn <b>Python</b>.
          Although I lost focus for about three years, that foundational
          knowledge in both theory and practice still benefits me immensely. I
          believe it has equipped me with a versatile skill set, even though I'm
          still seeking my first professional opportunity to gain experience and
          fund my original programming aspirations. During my initial studies at
          AltSchool Africa, particularly the module on career choices based on
          personality, I was reminded of my core motivation for learning to
          code: <b>building intelligent systems to solve problems</b>. For a
          while, I got sidetracked by trending UI development and similar areas,
          but now I'm fully back on track, grinding daily, and actively building
          my <b>LinkedIn profile</b> to seek work. I'm incredibly happy to be
          part of the AltSchool Africa movement. Through this platform, I aim to
          develop my character within the tech world, learn valuable
          collaboration skills, build awesome projects, and significantly
          increase my chances of landing a job in <b>Cloud Engineering</b>. My
          goal is to focus primarily on Cloud Engineering so that I can pursue
          what I love while balancing my passion with earning potential and
          working towards my long-term dreams. Hi, I am a student of AltSchool
          Africa, currently enrolled in the School of Engineering. I love
          writing code and building logical and functional systems to make an
          impact on many lives. I have always been very curious about Cloud
          Engineering. I searched for online platforms where I could learn cloud
          technologies, but the free ones only utilized the console, not
          Terraform IaC with industrial experience, which left me unsatisfied. I
          am very happy to be a student at AltSchool Africa because it is a
          platform that will help me achieve my dream of becoming a Cloud
          Engineer. I am looking forward to learning more about the cloud and
          how to use Terraform to manage cloud resources. I joined the School of
          Engineering at AltSchool Africa because of my passion. Even when I
          didn't have much money, I used my small savings to purchase online
          cards to subscribe to AWS for the free trial because I was eager to
          learn. However, with so many roles available in Cloud Engineering, I'm
          now confused about how and where to start. Joining AltSchool Africa
          will truly help me navigate which role would be best for someone like
          me.
