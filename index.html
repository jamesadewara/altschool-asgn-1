        <h3>Logical & Functional Systems Expert</h3>

      <div>
        <p>
          My passion for problem-solving began at the young age of 14, even
          though I lacked the resources to bring my initial solutions to life.
          Early on, I even delved into <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> as a
          prerequisite for a course, which led me to learn <b>Python</b>.
          Although I lost focus for about three years, that foundational
          knowledge in both theory and practice still benefits me immensely.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe it has equipped me with a versatile skill set, even though I'm
          still seeking my first professional opportunity to gain experience and
          fund my original programming aspirations. During my initial studies at
          AltSchool Africa, particularly the module on career choices based on
          personality, I was reminded of my core motivation for learning to
          code: <b>building intelligent systems to solve problems</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a while, I got sidetracked by trending UI development and similar
          areas, but now I'm fully back on track, grinding daily, and actively
          building my <b>LinkedIn profile</b> to seek work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm incredibly happy to be part of the AltSchool Africa movement.
          Through this platform, I aim to develop my character within the tech
          world, learn valuable collaboration skills, build awesome projects, and
          significantly increase my chances of landing a job in
          <b>Cloud Engineering</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to focus primarily on Cloud Engineering so that I can pursue
          what I love while balancing my passion with earning potential and
          working towards my long-term dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love writing code and building logical and functional systems to make
          an impact on many lives. I have always been very curious about Cloud
          Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I searched for online platforms where I could learn cloud technologies,
          but the free ones only utilized the console, not Terraform IaC with
          industrial experience, which left me unsatisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very happy to be a student at AltSchool Africa because it is a
          platform that will help me achieve my dream of becoming a Cloud
          Engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined the School of Engineering at AltSchool Africa because of my
          passion. Even when I didn't have much money, I used my small savings to
          purchase online cards to subscribe to AWS for the free trial because I
          was eager to learn. However, with so many roles available in Cloud
          Engineering, I'm now confused about how and where to start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joining AltSchool Africa will truly help me navigate which role would
          be best for someone like me.
