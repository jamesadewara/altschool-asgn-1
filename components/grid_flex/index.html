                        <h4>Programming & Competitions</h4>
                        <p>For a long time, I avoided competitions because of fear and my struggles with social connections. Recently, I’ve started stepping out of that comfort zone, joining challenges as a way to connect with others and grow my confidence. It’s a work in progress, but I’m excited to see where it leads.</p>

                        <h4>Reading & Learning</h4>
                        <p>I have a habit of reading technology books and articles that spark my curiosity. This helped me stay updated with software development trends and advancements, although lately I’ve been feeling a bit drained. Still, I believe consistent learning will keep opening doors to the fields I truly want to master.</p>

                        <h4>Solution-Oriented Leader & Technologist</h4>
                        <p>I aspire to grow into a technology leader who guides teams in building innovative solutions that make a real impact on people’s lives. My journey started with full-stack development, initially as a way to fund my passion for robotics. Along the way, I explored areas like 3D design, robotics, embedded systems(not really much that reading an article), and AI/Deep RL. While I sometimes get tired of front-end basics like HTML and CSS, my bigger vision remains, to dive deeper into robotics and eventually cloud engineering.</p>
